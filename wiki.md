# Troubleshooting

**PHP Warning: Input variables exceeded 1000. To increase the limit change max_input_vars in php.ini.**

For orders that contain too many products, this PHP warning may be issued. You will need to:

- Open your php.ini file
- Edit the max_input_vars variable. This specifies the maximum number of variables that can be sent in a request. The default is 1000. Increase it to, say, 3000.
- Restart your server.

**Parameters: description/unitPrice/quantity are required for each orderline, but was not set for line: xxxx**
> The same problem as above. The request is being truncated because the number of variables are exceeding the max_input_vars limit.
